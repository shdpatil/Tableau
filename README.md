### Summary:

I used Titanic Dataset for my Data visualization. First I analyzed the total number of records and the survival rate depending on gender, pclass and embarkment. Then I analysed and compared the fare paid at each port and Cabins booked by passengers, and survival based on that. Then I analysed the age and survival ratio and also I created a new Family field to compare the survival rate of passangers travelling alone to the passengers travelling with the family members. According to my analysis minor female travelling in first class with the family having a Cabin has more chances to survive than a aged male travelling in third classs alone without a cabin. May be because of the loc

### Design:

After having a good look at the Titanic data set .csv file I found Survived field the most important one because it will give the result of how many passengers survived and how many died. Then the Embarked, Sex and Pclass were important because,I thought these were the fields which were going to help me draw conclusions and finally Age, Cabin, fare, Parched and Sibsp can be used to analyze the data deeply. So for my initial sheets I used basic bar graph to show how many total passengers were travelling and how many survived based on gender. For the second sheet I thought the bubble chart will be more effective to show the passengers travelling in different classes. Then the story started evolving as I started to dig deeper. I analyzed the survival based on age, based on fare, based on gender, based on having a cabin and based on travelling with family vs travelling alone. All these factors affected the survival rate, so I included all these factors in my visualization. On the other hand fields like Name, PassengerId and Ticket dosen't seemed to have any impact on the survival rate so I didn't included those fields in my visualization.


### Feedback: Below are the feedbacks which I received for my initial work.

 1)Feedback 1st:<li>Increase the variety of graphs used - bar chart is now the predominant leader, consider other types of graphs such as boxplot 
 and histogram to add more variation</li>. <li>Consider consolidating similar graphs - for example, survival rate based on embarking ports, 
 currently, it’s available on multiple slides, after consolidation, there’ll be fewer slides and maybe clearer focus for each slide.</li> <li> Optimize some graphs to make them easier to interpret - For example, on the first slide, it’s not clear what the greyed area represent in the upper graph; for the bottom one, the number 1, 2, 3 might be wrongly interpreted as number of passengers.</li>
 
 2)Feedback 2nd: <li>Your visualization looks stunning. The conclusion photo is really nice, it is familiar though. It brings a fresh perspective.</li>
Here are my observations.
<li>Your revelations about data in systematic manner is appreciable.</li>
<li>The conclusion page could be given some kind of information which you have written on the box. Some kind of graph would have been better.</li>
<li>You should always remove the null data while presenting or visualizing the data.</li>
Hope it helps!!!

So I made changes accordingly.
<li>According to the feedback given for my first sheet I made changes to remove the grey area.</li>
<li>For my second sheet I made aliases for the pclass field for better understanding.</li>
<li>I made changes in size and shape of data points for better visualization in my seventh sheet.</li>
<li>I changed the bar graph to table for my 5th sheet.</li>
<li>I used a boxplot for my 8th sheet and changed the variables like embarkment and used Fare.</li>
<li>Also I removed the bar graph and used the table chart for my 9th sheet.</li>
<li>I hid my 10th sheet to avoid repeatation, and I changed my 11th sheet for same reason, and used Cabin field to analyze the data.</li>
